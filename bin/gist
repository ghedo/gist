=head1 CONFIGURATION

The login username and the API token can be set via the GITHUB_USER and
GITHUB_TOKEN environment variables. If not set, will be used the
values of C<github.user> and C<github.token> from the Git configuration.
To set them, type:

    $ git config --global github.user LoginName
    $ git config --global github.token GitHubToken

If neither C<github.user> and C<github.token> are set, the login name and
the API token will be asked interactively to the user.

=head1 TOKEN

The API token can be found on the C<Account Settings> page on GitHub.
Visit the url: L<https://github.com/account>
